Before we start this course, let’s talk about what even is system design. System design is the process of defining the architecture, interfaces, and data for a system that satisfies specific requirements. System design meets the needs of your business or organization through coherent and efficient systems. It requires a systematic approach to building and engineering systems. A good system design requires us to think about everything, from infrastructure all the way down to the data and how it’s stored.

System design helps us define a solution that meets the business requirements. It is one of the earliest decisions we can make when building a system. Often it is essential to think from a high level as these decisions are very difficult to correct later. It also makes it easier to reason about and manage architectural changes as the system evolves. IP An IP address is a unique address that identifies a device on the internet or a local network. IP stands for “Internet Protocol”, which is the set of rules governing the format of data sent via the internet or local network. In essence, IP addresses are the identifier that allows information to be sent between devices on a network. They contain location information and make devices accessible for communication. The internet needs a way to differentiate between different computers, routers, and websites. IP addresses provide a way of doing so and form an essential part of how the internet works.

OSI Model The OSI Model is a logical and conceptual model that defines network communication used by systems open to interconnection and communication with other systems. The Open System Interconnection (OSI Model) also defines a logical network and effectively describes computer packet transfer by using various layers of protocols.

This allows workloads consisting of a high number of individual, parallelizable tasks to be distributed among the nodes in the cluster. As a result, these tasks can leverage the combined memory and processing power of each computer to increase overall performance. To build a computer cluster, the individual nodes should be connected to a network to enable internode communication. The software can then be used to join the nodes together and form a cluster. It may have a shared storage device and/or local storage on each node. Typically, at least one node is designated as the leader node and acts as the entry point to the cluster. The leader node may be responsible for delegating incoming work to the other nodes and, if necessary, aggregating the results and returning a response to the user. Ideally, a cluster functions as if it were a single system. A user accessing the cluster should not need to know whether the system is a cluster or an individual machine. Furthermore, a cluster should be designed to minimize latency and prevent bottlenecks in node-to-node communication.

A cache also gets written if requested, such as when there has been an update and new content needs to be saved to the cache, replacing the older content that was saved. No matter whether the cache is read or written, it’s done one block at a time. Each block also has a tag that includes the location where the data was stored in the cache. When data is requested from the cache, a search occurs through the tags to find the specific content that’s needed in level one (L1) of the memory. If the correct data isn’t found, more searches are conducted in L2. If the data isn’t found there, searches are continued in L3, then L4, and so on until it has been found, then, it’s read and loaded.

In a CDN, the origin server contains the original versions of the content while the edge servers are numerous and distributed across various locations around the world. To minimize the distance between the visitors and the website’s server, a CDN stores a cached version of its content in multiple geographical locations known as edge locations. Each edge location contains a number of caching servers responsible for content delivery to visitors within its proximity. Once the static assets are cached on all the CDN servers for a particular location, all subsequent website visitor requests for static assets will be delivered from these edge servers instead of the origin, thus reducing origin load and improving scalability. For example, when someone in the UK requests our website which might be hosted in the USA, they will be served from the closest edge location such as the London edge location.

Ensuring data security: Data breaches are happening everywhere these days, it’s more important than ever to ensure that data is secure but also easily accessible to users. Keeping up with demand: Companies need real-time access to their data to support timely decision-making and to take advantage of new opportunities. Managing and maintaining the database and infrastructure: As databases become more complex and data volumes grow, companies are faced with the expense of hiring additional talent to manage their databases. Removing limits on scalability: A business needs to grow if it’s going to survive, and its data management must grow along with it. But it’s very difficult to predict how much capacity the company will need, particularly with on-premises databases. Ensuring data residency, data sovereignty, or latency requirements: Some organizations have use cases that are better suited to run on-premises. In those cases, engineered systems that are pre-configured and pre-optimized for running the database are ideal. SQL databases A SQL (or relational) database is a collection of data items with pre-defined relationships between them. These items are organized as a set of tables with columns and rows. Tables are used to hold information about the objects to be represented in the database. Each column in a table holds a certain kind of data and a field stores the actual value of an attribute. The rows in the table represent a collection of related values of one object or entity. Each row in a table could be marked with a unique identifier called a primary key, and rows among multiple tables can be made related using foreign keys. This data can be accessed in many different ways without re-organizing the database tables themselves. SQL databases usually follow the ACID consistency model.

In synchronous replication, data is written to primary storage and the replica simultaneously. As such, the primary copy and the replica should always remain synchronized. In contrast, asynchronous replication copies the data to the replica after the data is already written to the primary storage. Although the replication process may occur in near-real-time, it is more common for replication to occur on a scheduled basis and it is more cost-effective. Indexes Indexes are well known when it comes to databases, they are used to improve the speed of data retrieval operations on the data store. An index makes the trade-offs of increased storage overhead, and slower writes (since we not only have to write the data but also have to update the index) for the benefit of faster reads. Indexes are used to quickly locate data without having to examine every row in a database table. Indexes can be created using one or more columns of a database table, providing the basis for both rapid random lookups and efficient access to ordered records. An index is a data structure that can be perceived as a table of contents that points us to the location where actual data lives. So when we create an index on a column of a table, we store that column and a pointer to the whole row in the index. Indexes are also used to create different views of the same data. For large data sets, this is an excellent way to specify different filters or sorting schemes without resorting to creating multiple additional copies of the data. One quality that database indexes can have is that they can be dense or sparse. Each of these index qualities comes with its own trade-offs. Let’s look at how each index type would work: ","date":"2022-10-04","objectID":"/blog/system-design/:77:0","tags":["system-design","distributed-systems","hashing","caching","distributed-systems","sql","cdn","storage","rest-api","scalability","proxy-server","databases","design-patterns","transactions","sharding","nosql-database","design-system","database-replication","design-interviews","cap-theorem","system-design-interviews","api-gateway","rest","graphql","grpc","message-queues","monoliths","microservices"],"title":"System Design Course","uri":"/blog/system-design/"},{"categories":["system-design","interview"],"content":"Dense Index In a dense index, an index record is created for every row of the table. Records can be located directly as each record of the index holds the search key value and the pointer to the actual record. Dense indexes require more maintenance than sparse indexes at write-time.

Update anomaly: Occurs in case of data redundancy and partial update. In other words, a correct update of the database needs other actions such as addition, deletion, or both. Deletion anomaly: Occurs where deletion of some data requires deletion of other data. Example Let’s consider the following table which is not normalized: ID Name Role Team 1 Peter Software Engineer A 2 Brian DevOps Engineer B 3 Hailey Product Manager C 4 Hailey Product Manager C 5 Steve Frontend Engineer D Let’s imagine, we hired a new person “John” but they might not be assigned a team immediately. This will cause an insertion anomaly as the team attribute is not yet present. Next, let’s say Hailey from Team C got promoted, to reflect that change in the database, we will need to update 2 rows to maintain consistency which can cause an update anomaly. Finally, we would like to remove Team B but to do that we will also need to remove additional information such as name and role, this is an example of a deletion anomaly.

Let’s discuss some essential normal forms: 1NF For a table to be in the first normal form (1NF), it should follow the following rules: Repeating groups are not permitted. Identify each set of related data with a primary key. Set of related data should have a separate table. Mixing data types in the same column is not permitted. 2NF For a table to be in the second normal form (2NF), it should follow the following rules: Satisfies the first normal form (1NF). Should not have any partial dependency. 3NF For a table to be in the third normal form (3NF), it should follow the following rules: Satisfies the second normal form (2NF). Transitive functional dependencies are not permitted. BCNF Boyce-Codd normal form (or BCNF) is a slightly stronger version of the third normal form (3NF) used to address certain types of anomalies not dealt with by 3NF as originally defined. Sometimes it is also known as the 3.5 normal form (3.5NF). For a table to be in the Boyce-Codd normal form (BCNF), it should follow the following rules: Satisfied the third normal form (3NF). For every functional dependency X → Y, X should be the super key. There are more normal forms such as 4NF, 5NF, and 6NF but we won’t discuss them here. Check out this amazing video that goes into detail. In a relational database, a relation is often described as “normalized” if it meets the third normal form. Most 3NF relations are free of insertion, update, and deletion anomalies. As with many formal rules and specifications, real-world scenarios do not always allow for perfect compliance. If you decide to violate one of the first three rules of normalization, make sure that your application anticipates any problems that could occur, such as redundant data and inconsistent dependencies.

If we perform a read operation on a consistent system, it should return the value of the most recent write operation. The read should cause all nodes to return the same data. All users see the same data at the same time, regardless of the node they connect to. When data is written to a single node, it is then replicated across the other nodes in the system. For this to happen, whenever data is written to one node, it must be instantly forwarded or replicated across all the nodes in the system before the write is deemed “successful”. Financial data is a good example. When a user logs in to their banking institution, they do not want to see an error that no data is returned, or that the value is higher or lower than it actually is. Banking apps should return the exact value of a user’s account information. In this case, banks would rely on consistent databases.

Microservices have become especially popular in hybrid cloud and multi-cloud environments, and they are also widely used in on-premises data centers. If you want to create a microservices application, you can use the CAP theorem to help you determine a database that will best fit your needs. PACELC Theorem The PACELC theorem is an extension of the CAP theorem. The CAP theorem states that in the case of network partitioning (P) in a distributed system, one has to choose between Availability (A) and Consistency (C). PACELC extends the CAP theorem by introducing latency (L) as an additional attribute of a distributed system. The theorem states that else (E), even when the system is running normally in the absence of partitions, one has to choose between latency (L) and consistency (C). The PACELC theorem was first described by Daniel J. Abadi. PACELC theorem was developed to address a key limitation of the CAP theorem as it makes no provision for performance or latency. For example, according to the CAP theorem, a database can be considered Available if a query returns a response after 30 days. Obviously, such latency would be unacceptable for any real-world application. Transactions A transaction is a series of database operations that are considered to be a “single unit of work”. The operations in a transaction either all succeed, or they all fail. In this way, the notion of a transaction supports data integrity when part of a system fails. Not all databases choose to support ACID transactions, usually because they are prioritizing other optimizations that are hard or theoretically impossible to implement together. Usually, relational databases support ACID transactions, and non-relational databases don’t (there are exceptions).

In traditional hashing-based distribution methods, we use a hash function to hash our partition keys (i.e. request ID or IP). Then if we use the modulo against the total number of nodes (server or databases). This will give us the node where we want to route our request. $$ \\begin{align*} \u0026 Hash(key_1) \\to H_1 \\bmod N = Node_0 \\ \u0026 Hash(key_2) \\to H_2 \\bmod N = Node_1 \\ \u0026 Hash(key_3) \\to H_3 \\bmod N = Node_2 \\ \u0026 … \\ \u0026 Hash(key_n) \\to H_n \\bmod N = Node_{n-1} \\end{align*} $$ Where, key: Request ID or IP. H: Hash function result. N: Total number of nodes. Node: The node where the request will be routed. The problem with this is if we add or remove a node, it will cause N to change, meaning our mapping strategy will break as the same requests will now map to a different server. As a consequence, the majority of requests will need to be redistributed which is very inefficient. We want to uniformly distribute requests among different nodes such that we should be able to add or remove nodes with minimal effort. Hence, we need a distribution scheme that does not depend directly on the number of nodes (or servers), so that, when adding or removing nodes, the number of keys that need to be relocated is minimized. Consistent hashing solves this horizontal scalability problem by ensuring that every time we scale up or down, we do not have to re-arrange all the keys or touch all the servers. Now that we understand the problem, let’s discuss consistent hashing in detail.

This allows servers and objects to scale without affecting the overall system. Using consistent hashing, only K/N data would require re-distributing. $$ R = K/N $$ Where, R: Data that would require re-distribution. K: Number of partition keys. N: Number of nodes. The output of the hash function is a range let’s say 0...m-1 which we can represent on our hash ring. We hash the requests and distribute them on the ring depending on what the output was. Similarly, we also hash the node and distribute them on the same ring as well. $$ \\begin{align*} \u0026 Hash(key_1) = P_1 \\ \u0026 Hash(key_2) = P_2 \\ \u0026 Hash(key_3) = P_3 \\ \u0026 … \\ \u0026 Hash(key_n) = P_{m-1} \\end{align*} $$ Where, key: Request/Node ID or IP. P: Position on the hash ring. m: Total range of the hash ring. Now, when the request comes in we can simply route it to the closest node in a clockwise (can be counterclockwise as well) manner. This means that if a new node is added or removed, we can use the nearest node and only a fraction of the requests need to be re-routed. In theory, consistent hashing should distribute the load evenly however it doesn’t happen in practice. Usually, the load distribution is uneven and one server may end up handling the majority of the request becoming a hotspot, essentially a bottleneck for the system. We can fix this by adding extra nodes but that can be expensive. Let’s see how we can address these issues.

Instead of assigning a single position to a node, the hash range is divided into multiple smaller ranges, and each physical node is assigned several of these smaller ranges. Each of these subranges is considered a VNode. Hence, virtual nodes are basically existing physical nodes mapped multiple times across the hash ring to minimize changes to a node’s assigned range. For this, we can use k number of hash functions. $$ \\begin{align*} \u0026 Hash_1(key_1) = P_1 \\ \u0026 Hash_2(key_2) = P_2 \\ \u0026 Hash_3(key_3) = P_3 \\ \u0026 . . . \\ \u0026 Hash_k(key_n) = P_{m-1} \\end{align*} $$ Where, key: Request/Node ID or IP. k: Number of hash functions. P: Position on the hash ring. m: Total range of the hash ring. As VNodes help spread the load more evenly across the physical nodes on the cluster by diving the hash ranges into smaller subranges, this speeds up the re-balancing process after adding or removing nodes. This also helps us reduce the probability of hotspots.

N-tier architecture N-tier architecture divides an application into logical layers and physical tiers. Layers are a way to separate responsibilities and manage dependencies. Each layer has a specific responsibility. A higher layer can use services in a lower layer, but not the other way around. Tiers are physically separated, running on separate machines. A tier can call to another tier directly, or use asynchronous messaging. Although each layer might be hosted in its own tier, that’s not required. Several layers might be hosted on the same tier. Physically separating the tiers improves scalability and resiliency and adds latency from the additional network communication. An N-tier architecture can be of two types: In a closed layer architecture, a layer can only call the next layer immediately down. In an open layer architecture, a layer can call any of the layers below it. A closed-layer architecture limits the dependencies between layers. However, it might create unnecessary network traffic, if one layer simply passes requests along to the next layer.

Message Brokers A message broker is a software that enables applications, systems, and services to communicate with each other and exchange information. The message broker does this by translating messages between formal messaging protocols. This allows interdependent services to “talk” with one another directly, even if they were written in different languages or implemented on different platforms. Message brokers can validate, store, route, and deliver messages to the appropriate destinations. They serve as intermediaries between other applications, allowing senders to issue messages without knowing where the receivers are, whether or not they are active, or how many of them there are. This facilitates the decoupling of processes and services within systems.

To broadcast a message, a component called a publisher simply pushes a message to the topic. All components that subscribe to the topic (known as subscribers) will receive every message that was broadcasted.

This promotes faster response time and reduces the delivery latency which can be particularly problematic in systems where delays cannot be tolerated. Dynamic Targeting: Pub/Sub makes the discovery of services easier, more natural, and less error-prone. Instead of maintaining a roster of peers where an application can send messages, a publisher will simply post messages to a topic. Then, any interested party will subscribe its endpoint to the topic, and start receiving these messages. Subscribers can change, upgrade, multiply or disappear and the system dynamically adjusts. Decoupled and Independent Scaling: Publishers and subscribers are decoupled and work independently from each other, which allows us to develop and scale them independently. Simplify Communication: The Publish-Subscribe model reduces complexity by removing all the point-to-point connections with a single connection to a message topic, which will manage subscriptions and decide what messages should be delivered to which endpoints.

Well, it depends. While each approach has its own advantages and disadvantages, it is advised to start with a monolith when building a new system. It is important to understand, that microservices are not a silver bullet instead they solve an organizational problem. Microservices architecture is about your organizational priorities and team as much as it’s about technology. Before making the decision to move to microservices architecture, you need to ask yourself questions like: “Is the team too large to work effectively on a shared codebase?” “Are teams blocked on other teams?” “Does microservices deliver clear business value for us?” “Is my business mature enough to use microservices?” “Is our current architecture limiting us with communication overhead?” If your application does not require to be broken down into microservices, you don’t need this. There is no absolute necessity that all applications should be broken down into microservices. We frequently draw inspiration from companies such as Netflix and their use of microservices, but we overlook the fact that we are not Netflix. They went through a lot of iterations and models before they had a market-ready solution, and this architecture became acceptable for them when they identified and solved the problem they were trying to tackle. That’s why it’s essential to understand in-depth if your business actually needs microservices. What I’m trying to say is microservices are solutions to complex concerns and if your business doesn’t have complex issues, you don’t need them.

Command and Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) is an architectural pattern that divides a system’s actions into commands and queries. It was first described by Greg Young. In CQRS, a command is an instruction, a directive to perform a specific task. It is an intention to change something and doesn’t return a value, only an indication of success or failure. And, a query is a request for information that doesn’t change the system’s state or cause any side effects. The core principle of CQRS is the separation of commands and queries. They perform fundamentally different roles within a system, and separating them means that each can be optimized as needed, which distributed systems can really benefit from.

Constraints In order for an API to be considered RESTful, it has to conform to these architectural constraints: Uniform Interface: There should be a uniform way of interacting with a given server. Client-Server: A client-server architecture managed through HTTP. Stateless: No client context shall be stored on the server between requests. Cacheable: Every response should include whether the response is cacheable or not and for how much duration responses can be cached at the client-side. Layered system: An application architecture needs to be composed of multiple layers. Code on demand: Return executable code to support a part of your application. (optional) HTTP Verbs HTTP defines a set of request methods to indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resource. Although they can also be nouns, these request methods are sometimes referred to as HTTP verbs. Each of them implements a different semantic, but some common features are shared by a group of them. Below are some commonly used HTTP verbs: GET: Request a representation of the specified resource. HEAD: Response is identical to a GET request, but without the response body. POST: Submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server. PUT: Replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload. DELETE: Deletes the specified resource. PATCH: Applies partial modifications to a resource. HTTP response codes HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed. There are five classes defined by the standard: 1xx - Informational responses. 2xx - Successful responses. 3xx - Redirection responses. 4xx - Client error responses. 5xx - Server error responses. For example, HTTP 200 means that the request was successful.

Geohash is a hierarchical spatial index that uses Base-32 alphabet encoding, the first character in a geohash identifies the initial location as one of the 32 cells. This cell will also contain 32 cells. This means that to represent a point, the world is recursively divided into smaller and smaller cells with each additional bit until the desired precision is attained. The precision factor also determines the size of the cell. Geohashing guarantees that points are spatially closer if their Geohashes share a longer prefix which means the more characters in the string, the more precise the location. For example, geohashes 9q8yy9mf and 9q8yy9vx are spatially closer as they share the prefix 9q8yy9. Geohashing can also be used to provide a degree of anonymity as we don’t need to expose the exact location of the user because depending on the length of the geohash we just know they are somewhere within an area.

The simplest way to solve this problem is to use sticky sessions in our load balancers so that each consumer gets sent to exactly one node but this causes a lack of fault tolerance and scaling problems.

This model’s problem is that additional requests can come through in the time it takes to perform a full cycle of read-increment-store, each attempting to store the increment counter with an invalid (lower) counter value. This allows a consumer to send a very large number of requests to bypass the rate limiting controls. One way to avoid this problem is to use some sort of distributed locking mechanism around the key, preventing any other processes from accessing or writing to the counter. Though the lock will become a significant bottleneck and will not scale well. A better approach might be to use a “set-then-get” approach, allowing us to quickly increment and check counter values without letting the atomic operations get in the way.

Disaster recovery Disaster recovery (DR) is a process of regaining access and functionality of the infrastructure after events like a natural disaster, cyber attack, or even business disruptions. Disaster recovery relies upon the replication of data and computer processing in an off-premises location not affected by the disaster. When servers go down because of a disaster, a business needs to recover lost data from a second location where the data is backed up. Ideally, an organization can transfer its computer processing to that remote location as well in order to continue operations. Disaster Recovery is often not actively discussed during system design interviews but it’s important to have some basic understanding of this topic. You can learn more about disaster recovery from AWS Well-Architected Framework.

Single Sign-On (SSO) Single Sign-On (SSO) is an authentication process in which a user is provided access to multiple applications or websites by using only a single set of login credentials. This prevents the need for the user to log separately into the different applications. The user credentials and other identifying information are stored and managed by a centralized system called Identity Provider (IdP).

SAML uses XML to pass messages, while OAuth and OIDC use JSON. OAuth provides a simpler experience, while SAML is geared towards enterprise security. OAuth and OIDC use RESTful communication extensively, which is why mobile, and modern web applications find OAuth and OIDC a better experience for the user. SAML, on the other hand, drops a session cookie in a browser that allows a user to access certain web pages. This is great for short-lived workloads. OIDC is developer-friendly and simpler to implement, which broadens the use cases for which it might be implemented. It can be implemented from scratch pretty fast, via freely available libraries in all common programming languages. SAML can be complex to install and maintain, which only enterprise-size companies can handle well. OpenID Connect is essentially a layer on top of the OAuth framework. Therefore, it can offer a built-in layer of permission that asks a user to agree to what the service provider might access. Although SAML is also capable of allowing consent flow, it achieves this by hard-coding carried out by a developer and not as part of its protocol. Both of these authentication protocols are good at what they do. As always, a lot depends on our specific use cases and target audience.

So, if we want to generate a URL that is 7 characters long, we will generate ~3.5 trillion different URLs. $$ \\begin{gather*} 62^5 = \\sim 916 \\space million \\space URLs \\ 62^6 = \\sim 56.8 \\space billion \\space URLs \\ 62^7 = \\sim 3.5 \\space trillion \\space URLs \\end{gather*} $$ This is the simplest solution here, but it does not guarantee non-duplicate or collision-resistant keys. MD5 Approach The MD5 message-digest algorithm is a widely used hash function producing a 128-bit hash value (or 32 hexadecimal digits). We can use these 32 hexadecimal digits for generating 7 characters long URL. $$ MD5(original_url) \\rightarrow base62encode \\rightarrow hash $$ However, this creates a new issue for us, which is duplication and collision. We can try to re-compute the hash until we find a unique one but that will increase the overhead of our systems. It’s better to look for more scalable approaches. Counter Approach In this approach, we will start with a single server which will maintain the count of the keys generated. Once our service receives a request, it can reach out to the counter which returns a unique number and increments the counter. When the next request comes the counter again returns the unique number and this goes on. $$ Counter(0-3.5 \\space trillion) \\rightarrow base62encode \\rightarrow hash $$ The problem with this approach is that it can quickly become a single point for failure. And if we run multiple instances of the counter we can have collision as it’s essentially a distributed system. To solve this issue we can use a distributed system manager such as Zookeeper which can provide distributed synchronization. Zookeeper can maintain multiple ranges for our servers. $$ \\begin{align*} \u0026 Range \\space 1: \\space 1 \\rightarrow 1,000,000 \\ \u0026 Range \\space 2: \\space 1,000,001 \\rightarrow 2,000,000 \\ \u0026 Range \\space 3: \\space 2,000,001 \\rightarrow 3,000,000 \\ \u0026 … \\end{align*} $$ Once a server reaches its maximum range Zookeeper will assign an unused counter range to the new server. This approach can guarantee non-duplicate and collision-resistant URLs. Also, we can run multiple instances of Zookeeper to remove the single point of failure.

To solve this problem, we can create a standalone Key Generation Service (KGS) that generates a unique key ahead of time and stores it in a separate database for later use. This approach can make things simple for us. How to handle concurrent access? Once the key is used, we can mark it in the database to make sure we don’t reuse it, however, if there are multiple server instances reading data concurrently, two or more servers might try to use the same key. The easiest way to solve this would be to store keys in two tables. As soon as a key is used, we move it to a separate table with appropriate locking in place. Also, to improve reads, we can keep some of the keys in memory. KGS database estimations As per our discussion, we can generate up to ~56.8 billion unique 6 character long keys which will result in us having to store 300 GB of keys. $$ 6 \\space characters \\times 56.8 \\space billion = \\sim 390 \\space GB $$ While 390 GB seems like a lot for this simple use case, it is important to remember this is for the entirety of our service lifetime and the size of the keys database would not increase like our main database.

Our service returns an HTTP 201 (Created) response to the user. Accessing a URL When a client navigates to a certain short URL, the request is sent to the API servers. The request first hits the cache, and if the entry is not found there then it is retrieved from the database and an HTTP 301 (Redirect) is issued to the original URL.

User Service This is an HTTP-based service that handles user-related concerns such as authentication and user information. Chat Service The chat service will use WebSockets and establish connections with the client to handle chat and group message-related functionality. We can also use cache to keep track of all the active connections sort of like sessions which will help us determine if the user is online or not. Notification Service This service will simply send push notifications to the users. It will be discussed in detail separately.

Media service This service will handle the media (images, videos, files, etc.) uploads. It will be discussed in detail separately. What about inter-service communication and service discovery? Since our architecture is microservices-based, services will be communicating with each other as well. Generally, REST or HTTP performs well but we can further improve the performance using gRPC which is more lightweight and efficient. Service discovery is another thing we will have to take into account. We can also use a service mesh that enables managed, observable, and secure communication between individual services.

We have two different options: Pull model The client can periodically send an HTTP request to servers to check if there are any new messages. This can be achieved via something like Long polling. Push model The client opens a long-lived connection with the server and once new data is available it will be pushed to the client. We can use WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE) for this. The pull model approach is not scalable as it will create unnecessary request overhead on our servers and most of the time the response will be empty, thus wasting our resources. To minimize latency, using the push model with WebSockets is a better choice because then we can push data to the client once it’s available without any delay given the connection is open with the client. Also, WebSockets provide full-duplex communication, unlike Server-Sent Events (SSE) which are only unidirectional. Note: Learn more about Long polling, WebSockets, Server-Sent Events (SSE).

This functionality will be handled by the presence service combined with Redis or Memcached as our cache. Another way to implement this is to track the latest action of the user, once the last activity crosses a certain threshold, such as “user hasn’t performed any action in the last 30 seconds”, we can show the user as offline and last seen with the last recorded timestamp. This will be more of a lazy update approach and might benefit us over heartbeat in certain cases.

If the recipient is not active, the chat service will add an event to a message queue with additional metadata such as the client’s device platform which will be used to route the notification to the correct platform later on. The notification service will then consume the event from the message queue and forward the request to Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) based on the client’s device platform (Android, iOS, web, etc). We can also add support for email and SMS. Why are we using a message queue? Since most message queues provide best-effort ordering which ensures that messages are generally delivered in the same order as they’re sent and that a message is delivered at least once which is an important part of our service functionality. While this seems like a classic publish-subscribe use case, it is actually not as mobile devices and browsers each have their own way of handling push notifications. Usually, notifications are handled externally via Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) unlike message fan-out which we commonly see in backend services. We can use something like Amazon SQS or RabbitMQ to support this functionality.

This decision will be helpful for users with limited network bandwidth as they won’t have to retrieve old messages unless requested. Which cache eviction policy to use? We can use solutions like Redis or Memcached and cache 20% of the daily traffic but what kind of cache eviction policy would best fit our needs? Least Recently Used (LRU) can be a good policy for our system. In this policy, we discard the least recently used key first. How to handle cache miss?

We can also use distributed file storage such as HDFS or GlusterFS. Fun fact: WhatsApp deletes media on its servers once it has been downloaded by the user. We can use object stores like Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage for this use case.

What about inter-service communication and service discovery? Since our architecture is microservices-based, services will be communicating with each other as well. Generally, REST or HTTP performs well but we can further improve the performance using gRPC which is more lightweight and efficient. Service discovery is another thing we will have to take into account. We can also use a service mesh that enables managed, observable, and secure communication between individual services.

So, let’s divide our problem into two parts: Generation Let’s assume we want to generate the feed for user A, we will perform the following steps: Retrieve the IDs of all the users and entities (hashtags, topics, etc.) user A follows. Fetch the relevant tweets for each of the retrieved IDs. Use a ranking algorithm to rank the tweets based on parameters such as relevance, time, engagement, etc. Return the ranked tweets data to the client in a paginated manner. Feed generation is an intensive process and can take quite a lot of time, especially for users following a lot of people. To improve the performance, the feed can be pre-generated and stored in the cache, then we can have a mechanism to periodically update the feed and apply our ranking algorithm to the new tweets. Publishing Publishing is the step where the feed data is pushed according to each specific user. This can be a quite heavy operation, as a user may have millions of friends or followers. To deal with this, we have three different approaches: Pull Model (or Fan-out on load) When a user creates a tweet, and a follower reloads their newsfeed, the feed is created and stored in memory. The most recent feed is only loaded when the user requests it. This approach reduces the number of write operations on our database. The downside of this approach is that the users will not be able to view recent feeds unless they “pull” the data from the server, which will increase the number of read operations on the server. Push Model (or Fan-out on write) In this model, once a user creates a tweet, it is “pushed” to all the follower’s feeds immediately. This prevents the system from having to go through a user’s entire followers list to check for updates. However, the downside of this approach is that it would increase the number of write operations on the database. Hybrid Model A third approach is a hybrid model between the pull and push model. It combines the beneficial features of the above two models and tries to provide a balanced approach between the two. The hybrid model allows only users with a lesser number of followers to use the push model and for users with a higher number of followers celebrities, the pull model will be used.

For example, Facebook used to utilize an EdgeRank algorithm, here, the rank of each feed item is described by: $$ Rank = Affinity \\times Weight \\times Decay $$ Where, Affinity: is the “closeness” of the user to the creator of the edge. If a user frequently likes, comments, or messages the edge creator, then the value of affinity will be higher, resulting in a higher rank for the post. Weight: is the value assigned according to each edge. A comment can have a higher weightage than likes, and thus a post with more comments is more likely to get a higher rank. Decay: is the measure of the creation of the edge. The older the edge, the lesser will be the value of decay and eventually the rank. Nowadays, algorithms are much more complex and ranking is done using machine learning models which can take thousands of factors into consideration.

For example, an average data size of two-hour raw 8K footage from a high-end camera can easily be up to 4 TB, thus we need to have some kind of processing to reduce both storage and delivery costs. Here’s how we can process videos once they’re uploaded by the content team (or users in YouTube’s case) and are queued for processing in our message queue. Let’s discuss how this works: File Chunker This is the first step of our processing pipeline. File chunking is the process of splitting a file into smaller pieces called chunks. It can help us eliminate duplicate copies of repeating data on storage, and reduces the amount of data sent over the network by only selecting changed chunks. Usually, a video file can be split into equal size chunks based on timestamps but Netflix instead splits chunks based on scenes, this slight variation becomes a huge factor for a better user experience as whenever the client requests a chunk from the server, there is a lower chance of interruption as a complete scene will be retrieved. Content Filter This step checks if the video adheres to the content policy of the platform, this can be pre-approved in the case of Netflix as per the content rating of the media or can be strictly enforced like YouTube. This entire step is done by a machine learning model which performs copyright, piracy, and NSFW checks. If issues are found, we can push the task to a dead-letter queue (DLQ) and someone from the moderation team can do further inspection. Transcoder Transcoding is a process in which the original data is decoded to an intermediate uncompressed format, which is then encoded into the target format. This process uses different codecs to perform bitrate adjustment, image downsampling, or re-encoding the media. This results in a smaller size file and a much more optimized format for the target devices. Standalone solutions such as FFmpeg or cloud-based solutions like AWS Elemental MediaConvert can be used to implement this step of the pipeline. Quality Conversion This is the last step of the processing pipeline and as the name suggests, this step handles the conversion of the transcoded media from the previous step into different resolutions such as 4K, 1440p, 1080p, 720p, etc. This allows us to fetch the desired quality of the video as per the user’s request, and once the media file finishes processing, it will be uploaded to a distributed file storage such as HDFS, GlusterFS, or an object storage such as Amazon S3 for later retrieval during streaming. Note: We can add additional steps such as subtitles and thumbnails generation as part of our pipeline. Why are we using a message queue? Processing videos as a long-running task makes much more sense, and a message queue also decouples our video processing pipeline from the uploads functionality. We can use something like Amazon SQS or RabbitMQ to support this.

Moreover, internet connection speeds vary quite a lot between different users. To make sure users don’t re-fetch the same content, we can use a Content Delivery Network (CDN). Netflix takes this a step further with its Open Connect program. In this approach, they partner with thousands of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to localize their traffic and deliver their content more efficiently. What is the difference between Netflix’s Open Connect and a traditional Content Delivery Network (CDN)? Netflix Open Connect is our purpose-built Content Delivery Network (CDN) responsible for serving Netflix’s video traffic. Around 95% of the traffic globally is delivered via direct connections between Open Connect and the ISPs their customers use to access the internet. Currently, they have Open Connect Appliances (OCAs) in over 1000 separate locations around the world. In case of issues, Open Connect Appliances (OCAs) can failover, and the traffic can be re-routed to Netflix servers. Additionally, we can use Adaptive bitrate streaming protocols such as HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) which is designed for reliability and it dynamically adapts to network conditions by optimizing playback for the available speed of the connections. Lastly, for playing the video from where the user left off (part of our extended requirements), we can simply use the offset property we stored in the views table to retrieve the scene chunk at that particular timestamp and resume the playback for the user.

We have two different options: Pull model The client can periodically send an HTTP request to servers to report its current location and receive ETA and pricing information.

We can use WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE) for this. The pull model approach is not scalable as it will create unnecessary request overhead on our servers and most of the time the response will be empty, thus wasting our resources. To minimize latency, using the push model with WebSockets is a better choice because then we can push data to the client once it’s available without any delay given the connection is open with the client. Also, WebSockets provide full-duplex communication, unlike Server-Sent Events (SSE) which are only unidirectional. Additionally, the client application should have some sort of background job mechanism to ping GPS location while the application is in the background.

SELECT * FROM locations WHERE lat BETWEEN X-R AND X+R AND long BETWEEN Y-R AND Y+R However, this is not scalable, and performing this query on large datasets will be quite slow. Geohashing Geohashing is a geocoding method used to encode geographic coordinates such as latitude and longitude into short alphanumeric strings. It was created by Gustavo Niemeyer in 2008. Geohash is a hierarchical spatial index that uses Base-32 alphabet encoding, the first character in a geohash identifies the initial location as one of the 32 cells. This cell will also contain 32 cells. This means that to represent a point, the world is recursively divided into smaller and smaller cells with each additional bit until the desired precision is attained. The precision factor also determines the size of the cell. For example, San Francisco with coordinates 37.7564, -122.4016 can be represented in geohash as 9q8yy9mf. Now, using the customer’s geohash we can determine the nearest available driver by simply comparing it with the driver’s geohash. For better performance, we will index and store the geohash of the driver in memory for faster retrieval. Quadtrees A Quadtree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. They are often used to partition a two-dimensional space by recursively subdividing it into four quadrants or regions. Each child or leaf node stores spatial information. Quadtrees are the two-dimensional analog of Octrees which are used to partition three-dimensional space. Quadtrees enable us to search points within a two-dimensional range efficiently, where those points are defined as latitude/longitude coordinates or as cartesian (x, y) coordinates. We can save further computation by only subdividing a node after a certain threshold. Quadtree seems perfect for our use case, we can update the Quadtree every time we receive a new location update from the driver. To reduce the load on the quadtree servers we can use an in-memory datastore such as Redis to cache the latest updates. And with the application of mapping algorithms such as the Hilbert curve, we can perform efficient range queries to find nearby drivers for the customer. What about race conditions? Race conditions can easily occur when a large number of customers will be requesting rides simultaneously. To avoid this, we can wrap our ride matching logic in a Mutex to avoid any race conditions. Furthermore, every action should be transactional in nature. For more details, refer to Transactions and Distributed Transactions. How to find the best drivers nearby? Once we have a list of nearby drivers from the Quadtree servers, we can perform some sort of ranking based on parameters like average ratings, relevance, past customer feedback, etc. This will allow us to broadcast notifications to the best available drivers first. Dealing with high demand In cases of high demand, we can use the concept of Surge Pricing. Surge pricing is a dynamic pricing method where prices are temporarily increased as a reaction to increased demand and mostly limited supply. This surge price can be added to the base price of the trip. For more details, learn how surge pricing works with Uber.

Horizontal partitioning (aka Sharding) can be a good first step. We can shard our database either based on existing partition schemes or regions. If we divide the locations into regions using let’s say zip codes, we can effectively store all the data in a given region on a fixed node. But this can still cause uneven data and load distribution, we can solve this using Consistent hashing. For more details, refer to Sharding and Consistent Hashing.

Least Recently Used (LRU) can be a good policy for our system. In this policy, we discard the least recently used key first. How to handle cache miss?

Introducing load balancers between clients, servers, databases, and cache servers. Using multiple read replicas for our databases. Multiple instances and replicas for our distributed cache. Exactly once delivery and message ordering is challenging in a distributed system, we can use a dedicated message broker such as Apache Kafka or NATS to make our notification system more robust.
